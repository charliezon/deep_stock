# Deep Stock

This project aims to build effective stock selection models based on deep learning tools such as Keras, Tensorflow, etc., for Chinese stock market participants.

## Data

### Raw data

Raw data are colllected using TDX (http://www.tdx.com.cn/) client with a tool that can press buttons of keyboard and mouse automatically according to aÂ prerecorded program.

### Data for learning

Raw data are converted to csv format for learning.

### Features

Basically, the features include turnover, increase rate, winner rate of recent thirty days and so on. The set of features will vary depending on the specific experiment settings.

## Stock trade strategy

Suppose we set the same rate for stopping loss and taking profit, then when the success rate is larger than fifty percent, we can profit. Therefore, our goal is to find the models with as high success rate as possible in this condition.
